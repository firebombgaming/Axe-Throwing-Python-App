# Axe-Throwing-Python-App
### By: Cullen Keen

### About:
This app is made in Python, no prerequisites are required, besides Python.
It does however need a bash/zsh console to run. This version is incompatible with Windows.

This app lets you play a 1v1 with a friend in any 10-round game really, but it was intended for axe throwing.

### Basic rules for axe throwing:
The scoring for axe throwing is as follows, drop marked as nothing, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 as the bullseye, and 8 as the kill-shot which can only be called twice.

The app then saves these games in a txt file named Score.txt. It gives you the date on which you played and adds new games to the bottom of the list.
